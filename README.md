# Modelling-an-Internal-Combustion-Engine
This was a project for our course "Computer Aided Engineering" for the semester Fall 2020. In this project, we were required to model the working of a single cylinder single piston internal combustion engine on a 3D modeling software. The 3D modeling software that we used was "PTC Creo 6.0".
