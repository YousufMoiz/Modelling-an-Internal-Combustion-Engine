# Modelling an Internal Combustion Engine
This was a project for our course "Computer Aided Engineering" for the semester Fall 2020. In this project, we were required to model the working of a single cylinder single piston internal combustion engine on a 3D modeling software. The 3D modeling software that we used was "PTC Creo 6.0".

# How to run
To run the assembly, you will first need to download "PTC Creo 6.0", which can be downloaded from the following link:
https://www.ptc.com/en/academic-program/academic-products/free-software/creo-college-download
After downloading the software, download all the part files and save them inside a folder. Open PTC Creo 6.0, and change your working directory to the folder where the part files were saved. Open the "engine.asm" file, which has the complete engine assembly with all the parts connected. Now you can play around with this assembly and view the kinematic analysis in the Mechanism Analysis section.
